#include <stdio.h> is called as pre-processor directive ; preprocessor replaces text starting with # with the actual content such as lib
This is how c imports before compilation begins.

        Preprocessor             Compiler
Source code -> Expanded source code -> Machine code

-----

Stdio.h is the standard i/o file, called header file. Contains declarations (prototypes) of functions.

Header files -> Declaration of functions                       C standard library -> Actual definitions of functions
Header is like a phone number that you can call                C Library is the actual person you can reach

They are fused by linker, for optimization using the difference of interface and implementation.

C Unary Operators – Manual-style Summary

Increment (++) / Decrement (--)
Increases or decreases a variable's value by 1.
- Prefix: ++x / --x (modifies before use)
- Postfix: x++ / x-- (modifies after use)

Unary Plus (+)
Indicates a positive value. Has no effect on numeric types.
Example: +x is the same as x.

Unary Minus (-)
Negates a numeric value. Equivalent to multiplying by -1.
Example: -x gives the arithmetic negative of x.

Logical NOT (!)
Inverts a boolean expression.
- !0 → 1 (true)
- !nonzero → 0 (false)

Bitwise NOT (~)
Flips each bit of an integer.
- ~x produces the bitwise complement.

Address-of Operator (&)
Returns the memory address of a variable.
- &x yields a pointer to x.

Indirection Operator (*)
Dereferences a pointer to access the value it points to.
- *ptr gives the value at the address stored in ptr.

sizeof Operator
Returns the size (in bytes) of a variable or type.
- Evaluated at compile time.
- Example: sizeof(int) → 4 (on most systems)

Cast Operator (type)
Explicitly converts a value to a different type.
- Syntax: (int)x, (float)y
- Used for type coercion in expressions.
