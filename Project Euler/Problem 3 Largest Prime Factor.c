/*
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

Solution:
Solved by Pollard's Rho.
The main function is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is our number.
Our computation is on d, where d = gcd(|x - y|, n) ; x = f(x),    y = f(f(x))

Example: if we have 91, then we do d = gcd(|x - y|, 91)

let x, y = 2
then x = f(2) = (2^2 + 1) = 5, and we use 5 as y
then y = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) = 26
the difference is 21, using gcd (21, 91), we get 7.
Using this alg with the number in problem 3 will give us the answer.

Note: Pollardâ€™s Rho is a probabilistic algorithm, 2 is a seed.
Raising to higher power can increase performance, but also higher chance to fail.
So changing C is prob the best bet.

I used unsign since stuff should just be positive, without it, long long would be in range regardless of complementary trait.
